# Claude Code post-loop slash-command reporter

A custom `/harness-report` slash command that, at loop termination,
generates a template-bound MDX report citing every kept commit and every
discarded experiment. Fires only post-loop — in-loop iterations never
invoke it, preventing the reporter from drifting into the decision path.

Sits at the only legal HITL boundary per the project's axis-2 charter.
Lives entirely inside `.claude/commands/` (axis1 = inner) — zero external
infrastructure.

Pairs with `llm-as-judge-audit` (post-loop, outer): the judge grades the
*artifact*, this reporter narrates the *process*. Two outputs, two
rippable signals.

See `harness/research/cc-post-loop-slash.md` for the template contract,
the artifact-citation invariant, and the probe against CC-native
`/ultrareview`.
