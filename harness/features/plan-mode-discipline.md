# Plan-mode discipline

The inner, single-agent realisation of axis-2's "HITL outside the loop"
invariant. Claude Code's Plan mode already blocks writes until an
approved plan exits — this feature obligates that mode as the *only*
legal HITL channel for autoresearch Goals, plus a Stop-hook transcript
linter that flags any in-loop `AskUserQuestion` as a protocol
violation.

Complementary to `fpt-hyperagent-multirole` (outer, multi-agent):
both cover the same user-charter invariant, but via opposite axis-1
implementations. Keeping both catalogued preserves the option to run
either on a per-Goal basis.

See `harness/research/plan-mode-discipline.md` for the three discipline
rules, the leak-rate probe, and the transcript-linter contract.
