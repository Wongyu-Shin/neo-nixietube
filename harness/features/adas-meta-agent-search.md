# ADAS Meta Agent Search

The outer layer: each feature in this very catalog is a tiny ADAS step.
The Meta Agent (Claude, reading the full archive in Phase 1) proposes the
next feature spec; the catalog accumulates.

Two importable mechanisms pinned to this feature:

1. Archive-conditioned generation — already implicit in autoresearch's
   git-log + results-log review. This feature makes it explicit.
2. Novelty filter on proposed features — MinHash Jaccard against existing
   feature specs; reject near-duplicates before spending TC budget.

Reflexion on *editor* failures is feature `reflexion`. This feature
reserves reflexion at the *design* level — why did a previously-proposed
catalog entry get discarded? — which has a different rippable signal and
therefore its own TC.

See `harness/research/adas.md` for the Hu 2024 benchmark numbers and the
concrete `scripts/harness/{propose,novelty}` implementation sketch.
