# DGM-H archive & probabilistic parent selection

Zhang 2026's open-ended exploration substrate: an archive of every
generated hyperagent (not just successes), sampled probabilistically
with weight ∝ performance × 1/(1+#compiled_children). Without the
children-count factor the archive collapses onto the current best;
without the performance factor search is random. The two-factor rule
is what preserves exploration while biasing toward fertile ancestors.

The project's `autoresearch-harness-results.tsv` + git history is
structurally an archive already — every experiment commit is retained.
What's missing is the parent sampler: the current loop always branches
from HEAD. This feature catalogues the gap and the fix.

Explicit non-overlap with `voyager-skill-library` (retrieval-by-
embedding of successes only) and `adas-meta-agent-search` (archive-
conditioned proposal without evolutionary weights). The feature
`meta-hyperagents-metacognitive` assumes this feature's substrate —
if this rips, that one loses its evolutionary base.

See `harness/research/dgm-h-archive-parent-selection.md` for the
quoted §3 mechanism, the full comparison table vs. Voyager, and the
two-local-optima fixture that drives the rippable probe.
