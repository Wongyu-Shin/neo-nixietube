# Claude Code hook-based in-loop guardrail

The only CC primitive that can abort a tool call *before* it fires. Lives
entirely in `.claude/settings.json` (axis1 = inner) and runs during agent
iterations (axis2 = in-loop). Fills the "emergency stop on destructive
ops" slot explicitly called out in the project's axis-2 charter.

Per-model load differs — Haiku volunteers destructive commands more
often than Opus, so the hook is more valuable on smaller models. The
live integration TC (`harness/tests/integration/destructive-ops.sh`) is
the rippable probe: once CC natively blocks the list for all three
models, the override is dead weight.

Complements `swe-agent-aci` (shapes what tools the model sees) —
this feature shapes what tool *calls* are refused at runtime.

See `harness/research/cc-hook-guardrail.md` for the full use-case survey
and the `scripts/hooks/` implementation sketch.
