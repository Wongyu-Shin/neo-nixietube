# SWE-agent Agent-Computer Interface tuning

Claude Code is itself a large ACI; its defaults may or may not fit a given
project. This feature captures the practice of *curating* the tool surface,
permissions, and hook-level guardrails for the autoresearch loop — strip
unused MCP servers, pre-allowlist read-only Bash patterns, block writes
outside `Scope:`.

Lives entirely in `.claude/settings.json` + hooks (axis1=inner). Its
rippable test is a token/iteration-count differential against the default
ACI: once the defaults catch up, the custom curation is dead weight.

See `harness/research/swe-agent-aci.md` for the Yang 2024 ablation numbers
and the neo-nixetube implementation checklist.
