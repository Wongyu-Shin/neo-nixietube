# Harness constitution

Durable, project-wide invariants pinned at `harness/CONSTITUTION.md` —
9 Articles covering axis classification, rippability, HITL boundary,
alignment-free separation, explicit clarification, no-contradiction,
LLM-wiki persistence, git-as-memory, and the amendment procedure.

Separated from per-loop spec documents so no single loop can redefine
what the harness fundamentally is. The agent reads it at Phase 1 of
every loop before reading the per-loop spec; conflicts halt the loop.

Complementary to `plan-mode-discipline` (mechanism) and
`alignment-free-self-improvement` (implementation) — this feature is
the *document* that declares both as invariants with Article numbers
operators and agents can cite.

See `harness/research/harness-constitution.md` for the spec-kit
precedent, the 9-Article mapping, and the rename-to-root rippable
probe.
