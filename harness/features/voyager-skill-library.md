# Voyager skill library

Persist every `status=keep` autoresearch iteration as a retrievable skill
card under `harness/skills/`. At Phase-1 of future loops, top-k relevant
skills are injected into context, letting loops compound across Goals
instead of starting from baseline every time.

Pair with the `reflexion` feature: failures go to `reflexion/`, successes
go to `skills/`. The rippable signals differ (failure-recall vs. success-
recall), so the two are tracked as separate features.

See `harness/research/voyager.md` for the full curriculum + skill-store
protocol and the open question of cross-Goal skill transfer.
