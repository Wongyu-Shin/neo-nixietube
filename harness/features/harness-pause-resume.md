# `/harness:pause` / `/harness:resume` / `/harness:send`

OpenHands-inspired graceful pause-resume UX. Operator breaks into a
running loop at any iteration boundary, writes a resumable checkpoint,
optionally injects guidance via `--hint`. Distinct category from
agent-requested HITL (Article III forbids that; operator-initiated
pause is always allowed).

Slash-command surface: `/harness:pause`, `/harness:resume <run_id>
[--hint]`, `/harness:send <run_id> "<msg>"` (mid-flight without pause),
`/harness:status <run_id>`, `/harness:abandon <run_id>` (graceful
terminate with post-loop report).

Composes with `dgm-h-archive-parent-selection` (checkpoints carry
parent commit), `plan-mode-discipline` (resume with hint may re-enter
Plan mode), and `gcli-agent-run-telemetry` (pause events in telemetry
stream).

See `harness/research/harness-pause-resume.md` for the full command
surface, checkpoint schema, and the operator-vs-agent HITL asymmetry
argument.
