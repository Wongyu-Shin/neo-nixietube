# Sandboxed open-ended exploration

Open-ended self-improvement is the feature; destructive meta-
modifications are the failure mode. HyperAgents endorses two
safeguards: (1) structural sandboxing of each candidate's modify+eval
cycle, (2) human oversight at batch cadence.

Partially inner-native: Claude Code ships `Agent({isolation:
"worktree"})` which covers execution isolation. What CC does *not*
ship is semantic merge-sanity: the child hyperagent can legitimately
rewrite `verify.sh` to `echo SCORE=999`, delete half the archive, or
bias `select_parent.py`. The deny-list in `cc-hook-guardrail` can't
see these because the commands are individually legitimate. This
feature adds the external `sane_delta.sh` that blocks cherry-pick
when the diff looks like archive manipulation or metric cheating.

See `harness/research/sandboxed-open-ended-exploration.md` for the
enumerated structural risks, the `sane_delta.sh` contract, and the
hostile-candidate rippable probe.
